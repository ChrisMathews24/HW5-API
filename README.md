## HW5-API
In this homework we worked on calling historical data of shares and crypto using API, then we calculated the current value of assets combining them into one dataframe. Then arranged the data by date index and organized all the other numerical data to same format to run Monte Carlo simulation. Using this newly made dataframe, we calculated 30 year returns.

Once this was done, we studied the potential returns available based on the capital investment depending on the time range. Then we were able to asses if his investments were good or he had to save more.
